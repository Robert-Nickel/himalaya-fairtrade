## General
### Website & No Paper
I provided this website as a *living documentation* for the current tasks and conditions for our collaboration, because things might & likely will change a lot over the experience both of us will get. Since paper gets obsolete too fast and we are not co-located at the moment, I consider this a good way to share, document and discuss agreements.

*Is it secure?* No, it is not secure, so we shouldn't put anything secret in here. In my experience, this website will get no attention at all, since it isn't linked at any other website. And even if it (against all odds) does get any attention: Consider it as advertisement for your shop!

### Trust & Estimations
**Estimations are not reliable in software development.**

The intention of providing estimates is to have an idea of the expected duration a task will take from the current point of view in order to help prioritizing the work as good as possible. But estimates are no commitment to deliver a work package in a defined amount of time. There are many reasons why something can be harder or easier then expected, so proper duration estimations can only be given in hindsight.

The good part of building an online shop: You have constant real time feedback, since you can always look at the current state and intervene if you consider something is not going into the direction you want it to go. This said, it becomes more clear that bidirectional trust is an essential prerequisite to achieve appropriate results in an appropriate amount of time.

### Responsibilities & Its Borders
As a trained and experienced software engineer I primarily take technical responsibility for the shop. Secondarily, I can provide some good advice and best practices on the topics of user experience, design and online marketing questions, since all these areas are closely connected. I cannot provide any legal, product or business advice.

## Questions
- Why does a product have "liniert, kariert, Adressbuch, Organizer" in the description? Which of those will be in the cover?
- Why is on the "Über die Größen" Page no image of DIN A5?
