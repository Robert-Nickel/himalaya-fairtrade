## General
### Trust & Estimations
Estimations are not reliable in software development.

The intention of providing estimates is to have an idea of the expected duration a task will take from the current point of view in order to help prioritizing the work as good as possible. But estimates are no commitment to deliver a work package in a defined amount of time. There are many reasons why something can be harder or easier then expected, so proper duration estimations can only be given in hindsight.

This said, it becomes more clear that trust is an essential prerequisite to achieve appropriate results in an appropriate amount of time. 

### Responsibilities & Its Borders
As a trained and experienced software engineer I can primarily take technical responsibility for the shop. Secondarily, I can provide some good advice and best practices on user experience, design and marketing questions, since all these areas are closely connected. What I cannot provide is legal advice or business advice.
